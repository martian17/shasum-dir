# shasum-dir
there was no easy way of making sure directories are the same across different systems.  
so I threw together something quick and dirty

# install
go to your bin folder, clone this repository, and rename the repo directory to something that doesn't collide with the command name. Then copy out the example shell file and do `chmod +x shasum-dir`. Rewrite the contents of the shell file to point to the installation directory, and you are all set!
